just testing google code.
The project it self is a program that lets a user select a directory, it loads all file and folder names of that directory into an array and checks if it can find correct information on the web for those movie names. Its just an exercise :)

example folder:

3.10.To.Yuma.DVDRip.XviD-DiAMOND

becomes

3:10 to Yuma (2007) [DVDRip ]

and it gets the poster image and saves it to the folder.
